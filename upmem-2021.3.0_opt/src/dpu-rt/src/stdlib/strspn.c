// TODO Possible optimization:
//  use of the table of indexation that indicates if the character should or should not be accepted/rejected
//  in this case we will need 128 bits (as there are 128 ascii characters) ( = 16 bytes = 4 words ) per thread
// => 4x24 = 96 words of 32 bits.
//
//  TODO Another solution would be to stock this table only temporarily with the allocation function, but, currently, it's not an
//  option.
