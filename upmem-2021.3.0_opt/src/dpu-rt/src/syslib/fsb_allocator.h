/**
 * @file fsb_allocator.h
 * @brief Provides a fixed-size block memory allocator.
 *
 * @internal When defining an allocator, the total memory needed will be allocated, using mem_alloc.
 *           The allocator structure is a pointer to the next available block. In each free block, the first four bytes
 *           store a pointer to the following free block, creating a linked list. To allocate a block, we just check
 *           the free pointer, check the next free pointer and update the free pointer accordingly. To free a block, we
 *           just check the free pointer, update it with the newly free block, and update the next pointer of this block
 *           with the previous free pointer.
 *           There is no protection to prevent invalid block to be added to the list. Moreover, the list being in the free
 *           blocks, if there is some memory overflow from a block, the list might be corrupted and totally invalid.
