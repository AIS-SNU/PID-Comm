/**
 * @file mutex.h
 * @brief Mutual exclusions.
 *
 * A mutex ensures mutual exclusion between threads: only one thread can have the mutex at a time, blocking all the
 * other threads trying to take the mutex.
 *
 * @internal All the mutexes are stored in a table in WRAM. In this table, each byte represents a mutex,
 *           and can be accessed directly by taking the base address of the table and adding it the sysname of the mutex
 *           we want (thus, the sysname should be an integer in the range [0; NB_MUTEX -1]). The result of
 *           this addition is what a mutex_get will return.
 *           A lock is made by using an lb_a instruction on the address of the mutex given as a parameter.
 *           An unlock is made by using an sb_r instruction on the address of the mutex given as a parameter.
 *           The id of the thread doing the unlock is what is currently stored at the address of the mutex.
 *           The base address of this table is associated with the pointer defined by __MUTEX_TABLE__.
